HW2_Problem1_Summary

Step 1:
	Read in the data points from masses.txt
	Read this in as a numpy array where the first column is Z,
	     the second column is A, and the third column is BE
Step 2:
	Write a root mean square error function (or find one in the
	scipy module...)
Step 3:
	Minimize the root mean square of the error using scipy
Step 4:
	Plot the data points and the calculated results (with calculated coeffs)
	Remember to use the XKCD module in matplotlib!
